   - Archive evaluation data if needed

2. **Update Session Info**
   - Change year to new hackathon year
   - Update title/subtitle if changed
   - Update organization details if needed

3. **Review Jury Panel**
   - Add new jury members if any
   - Remove/deactivate unavailable members
   - Update contact information

4. **Reset Teams**
   - Remove previous year teams (set to inactive)
   - Add new participating teams

5. **Review Evaluation Criteria**
   - Update criteria if evaluation process changed

## Data Persistence

### Automatic Updates
- Configuration changes are applied immediately
- Existing evaluation data is preserved when possible
- Storage structure updates automatically for config changes

### Safe Modifications
- Only active items appear in evaluation interface
- Inactive items are hidden but data preserved
- Configuration changes don't affect submitted evaluations

### Deletion vs Deactivation
- **Deactivation**: Hides items from interface but preserves all data (recommended)
- **Deletion**: Permanently removes items and all related evaluation data (irreversible)
- **Best Practice**: Use deactivation instead of deletion unless absolutely necessary

## Best Practices

### Before Each Hackathon
1. Download backup of previous configuration
2. Test configuration changes in admin panel
3. Verify jury panel has access to their evaluation pages
4. Confirm team list is complete and accurate
5. Test evaluation criteria totals

### During Hackathon
1. Avoid major configuration changes
2. Only add teams/jury if absolutely necessary
3. Monitor system through admin dashboard
4. Keep configuration backup handy

### After Hackathon
1. Download final consolidated marksheet
2. Export individual jury marksheets
3. Backup complete configuration with evaluation data
4. Archive for future reference
